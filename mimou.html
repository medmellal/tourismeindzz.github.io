				Officially known as the Casbah, this is an ancient part of Algiers that is built on a hill overlooking modern Algiers. This part of the city dates back to the 17th century, founded on the ruins of old Icosium.

The Casbah is a UNESCO World Heritage site thanks to its exceptional architecture, which includes Ketchaoua mosque, mosque el Djedid and mosque El Kébir. It is also home to the Casbah Palace, which is well worth visiting.

The palace, or Dar Aziza, was built in 1791 and named after the Princess Aziza Bent ed-Dey. It is a beautiful, white palace with a courtyard, numerous terraces and a spectacular grand staircase.

				This magnificent Catholic basilica was built in the late 1800s and is a great example of the Neo-Byzantine style that was happening in French Algeria at the time.  It took fourteen years to build the church, which opened its doors on 1872.

Notre Dame d’Afrique sits on the north side of the city on a cliff overlooking the bay of Algiers. It’s often pegged as being a mirror for the Notre-Dame de la Garde, which is located in Marseille on the other side of the Mediterranean.

The basilica is unlike many others built at the time, as its floor plan means that the choir is at the southeast of the chapel, rather than the east. It also features 14 beautiful stained glass windows.

The monument is 92 metres high, consisting of the three palms, three Islamic turrets with a diameter of 10 metres each, and a six metre dome at the top. The site also has an amphitheatre and a crypt, as well as being home to the Museum of El Mujahid.

Maqam Echahid is located on the hills overlooking the Hamma neighbourhood. It took nine months to build and in February 1986 it was inaugurated by the then President Chadli Bendjedid .

The Great Synagogue of Oran was built in 1880, but inaugurated in 1918. It became the Abdallah Ibn Salam Mosque in the 1960s and was named after a 7th-century Jew that converted to Islam.

There is a magnificent castle and chapel on site, as well as a massive statue of the Virgin Mary. The statue is said to be a replica of the one at Notre Dame de la Garde in Marseilles.

It is well worth making the hike up to Fort Santa Cruz to admire the spectacular views. It also makes for a great escape outside of the lively city.

A stairway leads to a massive entrance porch and, through massive bronze-clad cedar doors, to the mosque, an open-sided, rectangular prayer space, beautifully proportioned and finely decorated in tiles and carved stucco.

The siege lasted eight years, during which the camp became a residence, complete with palace and mosque. Just as the city was about to fall, the sultan was murdered by one of his slaves and the Merinids retreated. Remains of the 12m-high walls that protected the camp stretch across the olive groves far into the distance. The main sight here is the remains of the massive mosque, rebuilt by Sultan Abou el-Hassan of Fès when he came to besiege Tlemcen in 1335.

The full name of the city was Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi. Trajan named the city in commemoration of his mother Marcia, eldest sister Ulpia Marciana, and father Marcus Ulpius Traianus.

Located in modern-day Algeria, about 35 km east of the city of Batna, the ruins are noteworthy for representing one of the best extant examples of the grid plan as used in Roman town planning. Timgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.

During Roman times it was called Cirta and was renamed "Constantina" in honor of emperor Constantine the Great. It was the capital of the French department of Constantine until 1962. Located somewhat inland, Constantine is about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the Mediterranean coast, on the banks of the Rhumel River.

Constantine is regarded as the capital of eastern Algeria and the commercial center of its region, and it has a population of about 450,000 (938,475[4] with the agglomeration), making it the third largest city in the country after Algiers and Oran. There are several museums and historical sites located around the city. Constantine is often referred to as the "City of Bridges" due to the numerous picturesque bridges connecting the various hills, valleys, and ravines that the city is built on and around.

Constantine was named the Arab Capital of Culture in 2015

Ahmed’s enjoyment of this wonderful place was short-lived. Two years after he moved in, the French chased him out and turned the palace into their headquarters and with independence the Algerian military moved in and set up camp.

Tamanrasset was originally established as a military outpost to guard the trans-Saharan trade routes. Surrounded by the barren Sahara Desert, very high temperatures of over 47 °C (117 °F) have been recorded here. Tamanrasset is located at an oasis where, despite the difficult climate, citrus fruits, apricots, dates, almonds, cereals, corn, and figs are grown. The Tuareg people were once the town's main inhabitants. Tamanrasset is a tourist attraction during the cooler months. Visitors are also drawn to the Museum of the Hoggar, which offers many exhibits depicting Tuareg life and culture.

It is located in northern-central Algeria in the Sahara Desert and lies along the left bank of the Wadi Mzab. The M'zab valley in the Ghardaïa Province (Wilaya) was inscribed under the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1982, as a cultural property evaluated under the criteria II (for its settlement affecting urban planning even to the present century), III (for its Ibadi cultural values), and V (a settlement culture which has prevailed to the present century).[3][4]

Ghardaïa is part of a pentapolis, a hilltop city amongst four others, built almost a thousand years ago in the M’Zab valley. It was founded by the Mozabites, an Ibadi sect of the Amazigh Muslims.[5][6]

It is a major centre of date production and the manufacture of rugs and cloths.[7] Divided into three walled sectors, it is a fortified town. At the centre is the historical Mʾzabite area, with a pyramid-style mosque and an arcaded square.[8] Distinctive white, pink, and red houses, made of sand, clay and gypsum,[9] rise in terraces and arcades
